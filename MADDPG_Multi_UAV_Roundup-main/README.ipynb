Multiple UAVs operate in a bounded airspace environment to coordinate to maintain formation and confine the target. The formation consists of 3 UAVs aiming to avoid environmental obstacles, maintain a roundup formation during the mission, and eventually successfully surround and capture the target.\n","\n","The code file and its main responsible functions are as follows:\n","\n","**buffer.py**: Implemented Multi-Agent Replay Buffer used for MADDPG\n","\n","**agent.py**:Responsible for training and maintaining an agent in a multi-agent system\n","\n","**maddpg.py**:Implemented the Actor-Critic training mechanism of multi-agents\n","\n","**network.py**: Implemented the Critic Network and the Actor Network for MADDPG\n","\n","**sim_env.py**:Define reward mechanism\n","\n","**mathtool.py**: Some calculation tools\n","\n","**main.py**: Train Process\n","\n","**main_evaluate.py**: Evaluate Process\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C_95TBKL7OU2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Y-15NL2zAe61"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3MtV76JQ2rCc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743201013264,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1316,"user":{"displayName":"彭筱涵","userId":"04031182232492599416"}},"outputId":"b2c861dc-439f-40a1-e52f-b667f5954a90"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Cloning into 'AI'...\n","remote: Enumerating objects: 34, done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Counting objects: 100% (34/34), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Compressing objects: 100% (32/32), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Total 34 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)\u001b[K\n","Receiving objects: 100% (34/34), 1.52 MiB | 5.75 MiB/s, done.\n"]}],"source":["#Clone a project from git repository\n","!git clone https://github.com/LYN1129/AI.git"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Enter the project folder\n","cd AI/MADDPG_Multi_UAV_Roundup-main/"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mUWeZrXN21eZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743201035927,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"彭筱涵","userId":"04031182232492599416"}},"outputId":"b19c4755-e4a1-4a3d-ab6c-8003dda245cb"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/AI/MADDPG_Multi_UAV_Roundup-main/AI/MADDPG_Multi_UAV_Roundup-main\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Perform training, save the training results in the tmp folder\n","!python main.py"],"metadata":{"id":"m1wvjt6z4Sm9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Perform result evaluation,\n","#the position results rendered by time step are in frames_output folder\n","#the speed results are in speed_output folder\n","!python main_evaluate.py"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ex0EYBPy2217","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743200963599,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":30993,"user":{"displayName":"彭筱涵","userId":"04031182232492599416"}},"outputId":"2efb8e74-fab9-43fe-b866-b449d63eaa54"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["... loading checkpoint ...\n","---- Evaluating ----\n","Round-up finished in 77 steps.\n"]}]}]}
